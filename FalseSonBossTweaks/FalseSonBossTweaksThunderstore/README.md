# False Son Boss Tweaks

A mod that tweaks the False Son fight, and has various changes. Changes include (and are all configurable):

- Tweaks to Eclipse difficulty False Son fight, to make it more fair (less reduction on his laser/skill steal cooldown, so he spams it less)
- Adds a small delay between the False Son dash and slam, to give you a bit more time to dodge it
- Slowing down the False Son during phase 2 laser. 
- Reducing the number of Golems during phase 2 to a maximum of 4 golems, and making them unable to become elite.
- Smaller credit amount for the Prime Meridian stage (450 -> 320)
- Fixing a laser ramping bug that causes the false son to ramp up his laser damage until the game is restarted.
