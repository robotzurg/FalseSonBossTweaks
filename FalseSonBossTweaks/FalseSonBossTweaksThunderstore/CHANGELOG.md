## 1.0.4
- Changed the time from dash to slam windup from 0.5s to 0.75s.
- (Hopefully?) fixed an issue where the false son would still spawn elite golems at times. 
- Changed the phase 2 combat director to spawn 4 golems, up from 3 changed in 1.0.2. (Feels a bit closer to the original fight, and knocking away elite golems helps well enough.)

## 1.0.3
- Fixed yet another issue with the phase 2 laser cooldown (can you tell I hate this skill yet)

## 1.0.2
- Fixed an issue where the phase 2 laser cooldown wasn't being reduced properly in Eclipse 7.
- Changed the Phase 2 Combat Director to only spawn a maximum of 3 golems, rather than 5.
- Changed the Phase 2 Combat Director to only spawn normal golems, rather than sometimes spawning elites.

## 1.0.1
- Fixed an issue where the cooldown for laser and skill disable skills weren't being reduced properly
- Fixed an issue where Stone Golem lasers would have double the cooldown on eclipse 7 (oops)
- Potentially fixed some multiplayer related issues (I hope)
- Removed the length reduction for False Son dash on Eclipse 4 or higher (wasn't working properly anyways lol)
- Added a new way to nerf the dash a bit, False Son will now stall for 0.5 seconds, then properly do a windup before slamming, rather than insta slamming. This feels a lot nicer in practice than the vanilla slam, while still being very threatening.

## 1.0.0

- First release of renamed FalseSonFairLaser
- Changed False Son from being completely stopped and gaining 2000 armor, to instead being heavily slowed during the phase 2 laser.
- Changed Phase 3 to be unaffected by this mod (it's not really needed cause of the small arena, and it kinda trivializes the entire 3rd phase)
- Changed False Son's Laser and Ability Steal skill cooldowns to be doubled in Eclipse 7 or higher. (This is to prevent him spamming these abilities in Eclipse 7 or higher, which just sucks to play against)
- Changed the combat director credits of Prime Meridian to be 320, down from 450 (for reference, sky meadows has 230 credits.) (Inspired by Nuxlar's meridian changes, thanks Nuxlar)
- Reduced how far the False Son dash goes in Eclipse 4 or higher.
