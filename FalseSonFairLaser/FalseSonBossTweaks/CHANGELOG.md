## 1.0.0

- First release of renamed FalseSonFairLaser
- Changed False Son from being completely stopped and gaining 2000 armor, to instead being heavily slowed during the phase 2 laser.
- Changed Phase 3 to be unaffected by this mod (it's not really needed cause of the small arena, and it kinda trivializes the entire 3rd phase)
- Changed False Son's Laser and Ability Steal skill cooldowns to be doubled in Eclipse 7 or higher. (This is to prevent him spamming these abilities in Eclipse 7 or higher, which just sucks to play against)
- Changed the combat director credits of Prime Meridian to be 320, down from 450 (for reference, sky meadows has 230 credits.) (Inspired by Nuxlar's meridian changes, thanks Nuxlar)
- Reduced how far the False Son dash goes in Eclipse 4 or higher.
